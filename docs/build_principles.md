# RSONA Build Principles

1. Artists are never punished for creating.
2. Value comes from attention, not volume.
3. Uploading must feel effortless.
4. Abuse is handled by weighting, not restriction.
5. Transparency beats cleverness.
6. If a feature adds fear, it is wrong.
7. RSONA is infrastructure, not a trend.
