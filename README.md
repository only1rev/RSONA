# RSONA

**Every sound you release keeps working for you.**

RSONA is an artist-first music distribution and value system.
It allows creators to upload music once, distribute everywhere, and earn from how people actually engage with their work.

This platform is built to remove unnecessary friction, gatekeeping, and artificial limits placed on artists—especially independent artists in Africa and the global south.

## Why RSONA Exists

Today’s music systems:
- Limit how much artists can release
- Pay late and opaquely
- Reward platforms more than creators
- Treat music as static content

RSONA treats music as a living digital entity.

Every song can optionally become an **Agent**—a system that listens for real interactions (plays, shares, saves) and converts them into value for the artist.

## Core Principles

- Artists are owners, not users
- Unlimited creative output
- No arbitrary upload limits
- Value follows interaction, not hype
- Simplicity over complexity
- Transparency by default

---

## What RSONA Is Building

- Simple, mobile-first music uploads
- Distribution to all major platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Boomplay, Audiomack, YouTube, and more)
- Real-time analytics
- Optional interaction-based value agents
- Artist-controlled monetization
- Africa-first, globally scalable infrastructure

## What RSONA Will Never Do

- Cap creativity
- Lock artists into contracts
- Hide earnings logic
- Exploit attention
- Punish volume over quality
